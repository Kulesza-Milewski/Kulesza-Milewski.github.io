            The IoT brings the power of the internet, data processing, and analytics, to the real world of physical
            objects—our everyday lives. For consumers, this means interacting with a global information network without
            the mediation of a computer keyboard or screen. It turns out that many everyday objects can download
            instructions from the internet, with minimal human intervention. In business settings, the IoT can provide
            the same efficiency in physical production and distribution that the internet has long provided for
            knowledge-based work. Millions (if not billions) of embedded, internet-connected sensors around the world
            provide incredible amounts of data that companies can freely leverage.

                <h3>How does the Internet of Things work?</h3>
                <p>
                    The foundation of IoT is data-collecting devices, each connected to the internet and with its own
                    IP address. They differ only in complexity, some are autonomous vehicles transporting products
                    around warehouses, while others are small sensors monitoring temperature in buildings. They also
                    include personal fitness trackers, reporting daily distances traveled.

                <h3>What benefits can it bring to your company?</h3>
                <p>
                    Thanks to IoT, companies have access to more data about their products and internal systems, and
                    therefore have a greater ability to implement changes and improvements. Many manufacturers are
                    taking advantage of the ability to add sensors to manufactured components to obtain data on their
                    performance. This allows them to more effectively detect failures, replacing components before they
                    cause damage.
